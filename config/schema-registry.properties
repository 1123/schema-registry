# Zookeeper connection string for the Zookeeper cluster used by your Kafka cluster
# (see zookeeper docs for details).
# This is a comma separated host:port pairs, each corresponding to a zk
# server. e.g. "127.0.0.1:3000,127.0.0.1:3001,127.0.0.1:3002".

# Zookeeper connection string for the Zookeeper cluster that schema registry instances
# should use to coordinate. Defaults to kafkastore.connection.url. Override this value
# if the Zookeeper cluster used to coordinate Schema Registry instances is different
# than the one used by the Kafka cluster storing the kafkastore.topic. This may be the
# case, for example, if you are using a hosted Kafka cluster that does not expose the
# underlying Zookeeper cluster.
#schema.registry.connection.url=localhost:2181

# Bootstrap servers for the Kafka cluster where your schemas will be stored.
# If not specified, bootstrap servers will be loaded from Zookeeper. If the
# Zookeeper cluster used to coordinate Schema Registry instances is different
# than the one used by the Kafka cluster storing the kafkastore.topic, this
# setting can be used instead of kafkastore.connection.url. This may be the case,
# for example, if you are using a hosted Kafka cluster that does not expose the
# underlying Zookeeper cluster.
#kafkastore.bootstrap.servers=PLAINTEXT://localhost:9092


# The name of the topic to store schemas in
