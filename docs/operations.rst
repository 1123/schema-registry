Schema Registry Operations
==========================

In this document, you will learn how to manage a Schema Registry cluster.

Here, we will cover three main topics:

* Monitoring your clusterâ€™s vital statistics, understanding which behaviors are normal and which should be cause for alarm, and interpreting various stats provided by Schema Registry 
* Deploying your cluster to production, including best practices and important configuration that should (or should not!) be changed
* Performing post-deployment logistics, such as a rolling restart or backup of your cluster
